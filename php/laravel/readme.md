# Setup

- [x] [Homestead](devenv/vagrant/homestead.md)

# Laravel setup

We must first install composer, as we generally use composer to create new project for Laravel.

- [ ] [Composer](php/composer.md)

Once we have composer installed, we can create laravel project using composer.

- [x] [Using global installer](php/laravel/install/global.md)
- [ ] [Using composer create-project](php/laravel/install/create-project.md)

# Basic setup

Once a new laravel project is created, we should do some basic setup steps.

TODO: Add basic setup steps.

# Database

This might looks surprise to someone but first thing I generally do before starting any project is to create its database; might not be perfect but at least a basic one.

[Migration](php/laravel/database_migration.md)
