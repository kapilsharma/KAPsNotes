# Selenium presentation points

## Selenium

- Selenium is open source tool for test automation.

## Benefits of automated testing

- Frequent regression testing
- Rapid feedback to developers
- Virtually unimited iterations of test case execution
- Support for agile and extreme development methodologies.
- Disciplined documentation of test cases.
- Customized defect reporting
- Finding defects missed by manual testing

## Automate or not to automate

Writing automated tests take time. There are times when we might not want to automate our test cases.

- If UI will change completely in near future.
- Lack of time to build automated tests.
- Short/small projects.
- Very tight deadline for testing.

## Prerequisite

Prerequisite for selenium

- Basic understanding of Java or any other object oriented programming language.

## Selenium tools

Selenium is not a single tool but a set of tools that help testers to automate web-application testing more efficiently.

These tools include:

- Selenium IDE
- Selenium RC (Selenium 1)
- Selenium WebDriver (Selenium 2)
- Selenium Grid

## Selenium IDE

Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a firefox plugin the lets us to record our actions.

Later on, selenium will follow same actions to do automated testing.

## Selenium RC

Selenium Remote Control (RC) (or selenium 1) was testing framework which use power of programming language to create more complex tests.

However it is not replaced by Selenium WebDriver (or Selenium 2).

## Selenium WebDriver

Selenium WebDriver sends command directly to the browser and retrieves result.

## Selenium Grid

Selenium Grid is a tool used to run parallel tests across different browsers on different machines.

It is mainly used for parallel processing, which improve time taken by automated test.

## Selecting right tool.

If you are not familiar with programming/scripting language like Java or Python or PHP, Selenium IDE is ideal choice to start.

Using Selenium ide, we can create simple tests quickly.

However to effectively use selenium, we must use Selenium 2 (WebDriver) or selenium 1 (RC) along with one supported language.


## Installing Selenium IDE

- Using firefox, Go to selenium downloads page
    - http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/
- Under 'Selenium IDE' click on latest version.
    - Firefox will prevent installing plugin. We need to click 'allow' to install it.
    - After installation, we will get prompt to restart firefox. Restart it.
- For generating PHPUnit from selenium
    - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-php-formatters/
