# Takshak University

Pratapgadh is the kingdom in Supreme Dimention.
Pratapgadh is famous for its 'Takshak University', which is headed by one of the greatest priest family and many other famous priest, astrologers, aaiyaars etc giving their service to train and prepare future generation. It is believed in Supreme dimention that if anyone reaches to the hights of their respective trade, he must be trained in Takshak University.

## Principal family

Ashwaniji's family is considered one of the most holy priest families and member of this family always headed Takshak University and broadly considered as owner of Takshak University.

Ashwaniji's great grand father Tezaswaniji was undisputed principal of the university and one of the most knowledgable person in the history of Supreme dimention.He was master mainly in medical science, astrology and also aaiyaar tricks, however he never used any of this knowledge for his personal good.

## Rajeshwani and Sukreshwaniji

Tezaswaniji had two sons; Rajeshwani and Sukreshwaniji.
Rajeshwani was elder son but not as genious as his family. Thus Tezaswaniji, decided to go against his family culture and announced his youger son Sukreshwaniji must succeed him as a principal of the university.

Everyone who know both Rajeshwani and Sukreshwani agreed to Tezaswaniji's decision. However Rajeshwani was shocked with that decision. He took it as personal insult. Although he could not oppose his father's decision but at the same time, he was unable to accept that he had to work under his younger brother. With time, his feeling got stronger against his own younger brother and he started making plans to dent Sukreshwaniji's image, without success.Then comes a time when he took a decision which changed the fate of Supreme Dimention. One day, when he got a chance, he poisened his younger brother hoping he will become principal of university after him.

BUT: crime cant be hidded for long, specially when someone like Hanumant Singh's great grand father Veer Singh around, who was greatest aaiyaar of his time. Veer Singh, with his investigations, exposed Rajeshwani.
Impressed by the proofs collected by Veer Singh, King of Maharajya ordered Rajeshwani to be hanged till death.
As a last wish, Rajeshwani asked a meeting with his son and strictly to no one else should meet him.
During meeting with his son, he asked two promices to his son Jyotishwaniji.

1. Being elder son of Tezaswaniji, it was his birth right to become the principal of Takshak University. Being denied to his birth right was injustice with him. However his decendents must get what was his birthright.
2. He felt that injustice was done against him. He was forced to kill his brother to get his birthright, which was not wrong given the circumstances. Thus killing his brother was right to get the justice. However king of Maharajya and Veer Singh did another injustice to him by punishing him and worse thing, punishment was also the life sentence. He was full of revenge at that time so his second wish was to finish the King of Pratapgadh and Veer Singh along with their fmilies.

Although Jyotishwaniji was elder and more talented to his cousin but his grand father Tezaswaniji was too annoyed to his father and made only mistake of his life by announcing younger and less talented Swadeshwaniji (Son of Sukreshwaniji) as future principal of Takshak University. This convensed even Jyotishwaniji (along with whole world) that his grand father did unjustice with him due to the act of his father.

After the death of Tejaswaniji, Swadeshwaniji removed Jyotishwaniji from all the roles in Takshak University due to the hatered towards his father.

Jyotishwaniji went to the King, asking justice. His point was, he could not be punished due to the act of his father. Injustice happen to him twice by his Grandfather and then by his cousin.

King and all is ministers were agreed to Jyotishwaniji but as per the customs, even King too could not interfear in University's internal matters and those decisions were taken by the sitting Principal of university so couldn't be reverted or questioned.

Thus King showed his unability to interfear in the matter but as a consolotion, helped Jyotishwaniji to setup a parallel university by providing land and money for the new university named 'Jyotish Vishwavidhyalaya' (Astrology University).
Jyotishwaniji was best in astrology and there was no good astrology teacher in Takshak University. Thus students who decided to take teaching or astrology as their future trade were forced to enroll in both the university; Jyotish Vishwavidhyalaya for astrology and Takshak University for other knowledge. Even Swadeshwaniji's son Jagdishwaniji, who have his main interest in astrology, went to Jyotish Vishwavidhyalaya to learn Astrology.
In Supreme Dimention, teachers do not take any fee from the students during the course but may ask anything as fee after the course. It was believed that if a student do not pay asked fee to his teacher, he got crused by the Gods and forgets the knowledge he got when he need it most. Again, he went to the hell and remain there for ever.
As a fee, Jyotishwaniji asked three promise from Jagdishwaniji:

1. When Jagdishwaniji become Principal of Takshak University, he will merge Jyotish Vishwavidhyalaya with Takshak University, leave Principal's post for his son Ashwaniji. Important condition was that, he need to do it in such a way that it looks his own decision but not Jagdishwaniji's order as teution fee.

2. As a second promise, he was supposed to leave Pratapgarh. Once he leave Pratapgarh, he can never return to the Pratapgarh again. Again, he can't tell anyone about where he is going and even at new place, he was supposed to keep his identity secret.

3. To stop hate wave against his family, he was not supposed to tell about these promise to anyone, not even to his father.


As a true human and student, Jagdishwaniji kept all his promise

In this way, Jyotishwaniji compiled his first promise to his father by making his son as Principal of Takshak University.Now Ashwaniji was both Principal of Takshak University and Head priest of Pratapgarh.
However fulfilling second promise was not easy because:

Veer Singh's family considered most skilled aaiyaar family and no other aaiyaar could stand against him without very strong reasons. Thus he could not get the services of any other aaiyaar against Veer Singh. Thus only option left to create some aaiyaar who matches the powers of Veer Singh's family. Only option was they own. Only the son of Veer Singh could match his other son. So he adopted the strategy of kidnap one son of fimily right in the initial years and prepare them to fight against another son.

Pratapgarh had friendly relations to nearly every kingdom in the area because all kings had studied in Takshak university during their teen years and had soft corner for Takshak University and therefore Pratapgarh, killing Pratapgarh's royal family was also not possible. so he passes his second promise to his son Ashwaniji.
