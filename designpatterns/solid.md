# SOLID Principles

SOLID is acronym of principles, that can be applied on software to remove bad code smells. It stands for

- S: Single responsibility principle
  - A class should have single responsibility. Thus, only one potential change in software specifications should be able to affect the specifications of the class.
- O: Open/close Principle
  - Means software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- L: Liskov substitution principle
  - Objects in a program should be replaceable with instance of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program. This is also known as design by contract.
- I: Interface segregation principle
  - This state that many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface.
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle
  - It states that one should depend on Abstractions but not on concretion.
