# Laravel global installer

We can have install `Laravel installer` globally. So this step needs to be done only once on every system. Open console (terminal) and run following command to globally install `Laravel installer`.

```bash
kapil@PHPReboot:~ $ composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1"
```

Once we have laravel installer, run following command to create new Laravel project.

```bash
