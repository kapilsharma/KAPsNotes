# Play Framework + coffee script + Scala

Assuming developers are familiar with java after week one training, this week will concentrate on Play framework, coffee script and Scala.

## Day 1

- View quick start video on website
- Download and install play framework on local box.
- Implement example shown in quick start video.
- Make minor changes in example to understand things better.

## Day 2

- Go through detailed documentation on website and experiment locally.
- Create Amazon account and play a bit about Amazon S3 through its Java libraries.

## Day 3 & 4

- Create an example application with following requirements
  - Front-end is not important, take any template from old project or free HTML template from internet. Important is, don't use default template of Play framework and customize your template to work with scala. Use coffee script to generate custom Java script.
  - User Registration/Authentication (Forget/Change password not needed) - 2 hours
  - Allow users to view photos and comment on them. (All users can see/comment on other users photo, no need for 'friend' functionality/authorization)
  - Comment should work with Ajax. Write Coffee Script to generate JS/JQuery for AJAX calls.
  - Allow user to upload photos.
  - Uploaded photos must be saved on Amazon S3.
  - Cassandra should be used for database (users/comments)

## Day 5

- Reserved day to complete example application, revise/learn some java/play framework topics.
