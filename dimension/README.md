# Supreme dimension

Few centuries ago, Takshak was not a single kingdom but group of many small states. Each of these states were fighting each other. Due to continious fights, these states become weak. This attracted other kingdoms to start raiding Takshak states, killing adult males, kidnapping kids and women as slave. During those days, life became like hell and families there started suicides so that they can save their families from becoming slaves of other kingdoms.

### Tunams

At that time, King Rudrapratap Singh of takshak was also defeated by other kingdoms and was living in forest with some of his loyals. To save his kingdom and subjects, he collected some of his warriors, scientest and priest, and asked them to research something so that his small army can protest regular raids and regain his freedom. He selected 7 persons for that task.

1. Tukaram Singh: He was general of his surviveing army. A fearsome warrior but at the same time, he was brillent in war science, a special branch of science he invented to ensure his army sruvive even when it was out numbered by 1:1000 or may be more against attacking nabours.

2. Naga Singh: Earlier he was general of Naval wing of Takshak. He too was a great warrior but due to loosing a naval bettle badly and loosing his whole navy, he was forced to join army under Tukaram.

3. Muskara Singh: He was the brigadier of Takshak army and before King Rudrapratap lost his kingdom, he researched some deadly weapons that he named as messiles. These weapons could fire for a long distance up to 3 KM and when exploded at correct target, could kill hundreds of enemy solgers. However he didn't got much fund and time to create many such weapens due to attack from east desert which forced king Rudrapratap to exile in forest.

4. Shakura: He was the head of spys of Takshak. However he lived in a tough time, where his spys had more role to play as warriors then spy. Still he was considered as one of the best spy of his time. He was capable to do perfect makeups to look exactly like other person, even with different health, height and even gender. Not proved but it is a romoures that he can even take a shape of animals.

5. Mahakaal Singh: He was a very good warrior, if not great. He didn't possess any other special skills. However one of his most important skills was his royalty towards his country. He proved it many times. His royalty made him so special for king and Tukaram that he was considered for this special squad.

6. Head priest Maha jyotish Rajnishwaniji: He was head priest of Takshak. He had a great knowledge of astrology.

7. Bhramrishiji: He was one of the greatest scientest of history in Supreme Dimention. He was devoted for the greater good.

After few years of research training and knowledge transfer to each other, they were succeed to create warriors who possesses skills impossible to believe ever before. These warriors were strong physically, mentally, in skills and most important biologically. They names this warrior breed as 'Tunams'. Words taken form 5 warriors:

* **Tu:** It was taken from Tukaram
* **Na:** Taken from Naga
* **M:** M represent both Muskara and Mahakaal. However over time, people started believing it only represent Muskara, specially once Mahakaal decendents disappeared.
* **S:** represent Shakura.

### How it worked?

Tunas achieved great skills by knowledge transfer to each other. However most important reason for their strength was meditation power of Rajnishwaniji and medical excellence of Bhramrishiji. Bhrmarishiji effected their DNA such that whatever knowledge they gain, should get transferred to their generations. However he also considered it could be dangerous and might create a new species of humans. So he arranged it in such a way that Tunams' knowledge will be transferred to their kids with DNA but before it could be used, it had to be activated. Again it can be transferred to first son at his full strength but for second son, it can be transferred with limited knowledge. Actually trick was the way it has to be activated, which was responsibility of Rajnishwaniji and his decendents.

### Communication

Bhramrishiji also mastered the technique to communicate via telepathy. It needed years of practice for a person to become master of telepathy. However that knowledge also gets transferred with DNA. All first generation Tunams were able to communicate with each other through telepathy, provided they both wants to communicate. Again first generation tunams can communicate with other tunams of their tribe, if agreed. Bhramrishi were able to communicate with any tunams, anytime. However they decided to remain neutral, until it is urgent.

### Risk and deciding to end this.

Bhramrishi also knew that tunams discovery will start creating chose over time. A time will come when tunams will become too dangerous, that it would threaten survival of life not only in supreme dimention **but in any known dimention** and other dimentions, if disturbed a lot, will cause collapse of dimentions and thus whole universe. Thus Tunam's powers must come to an end at that time.

### Lock houses

Lock house is another invention of Bhramrishiji and Rajnishwaniji. It is a special house with supreme technologies used to lock it. There were few locks which can be opened by first generation tunams as their special DNA was is the key for it.

### How to end?

Hanumant singh's family was given knowledge of special virus, which when released in air, will destroy the special DNA's and all future Tunams generation will born without special DNA. This will then end tunams breed. These special virus were put in a specially designed `lock house` that can be opened by a person with activated first generation tunam DNA.

### Tunams fight back

These tunams united takshak and combinly they fought back from attacking kingdoms to regain their freedom. Over next few generations, they attacked their nabouring kingdoms and brutally crushed them. However they knew the pain of salvery so even after defeating them, they set them free and let their kings rule their empire but under tunams so that they do not even dream to attack takshak again.

### Golden time & split

For next few hundred years, everything went fine. Takshak was powerful and wealthy kingdom. Like all good things come to an end, lower grade tunams started feeling they are superior from each other and started asking their first generation to demand for more powers from the king. Initially first generation tunams were remain friendly to each other as they knew they are powerful combinely. But slowly over next few generations, even first generation tunam were finding it difficult to keep their respective tribes quite. Their tribes started fighting and killing each other, even after a clear rule that two tunams are brothers and can not kill each other until extremely necessary.

At the same time, their nabouring kingdoms started to collapse and presented threat for Takshak.

To stop them, first generation tunams decided to separate and go to different kingdoms with their tribes. Even while deciding that, they kept in mind that their major taks is to keep takshak secure. They also decided they will no longer call them as tunams. New names were

* **Tukaram Singh's tribe = Tukas**
    - They remain in Takshak
    - Task: To keep Takshan secure from internal dangers.
* **Naga Singh's tribe = Nagas**
    - North (Naga Rusvan)
    - Task: To unite individual states for noth into a nation that will provide defence to Takshak from north and Great Lake.
* **Muskara Singh's tribe = Karas**
    - South (Sudham)
    - Task: To unite states in the south of Mount Suparv, control great natural resources of south, which are inviting other kingdoms to attack and control that area and provide defence to Takshak from any possible threat across great southern ocean.
* **Shakura's tribe = Kuras**
    - East (Netri)
    - Task: To unite states of east, and made them as solid defence from eastern barberians, who regularly raided Takshak in the past before Tunams were created. They were also the spy tribes so they were also needed to continiously spy eastern barberian kingdoms and alear other in advance, if there is any threat.
* **Mahakaal Singh's tribe = Hakas**.
    - They were considered weakest among Tunams but other tribes (Except first generation, who know their royalty is their biggest asset) So it was decided that they will remain invisible. It will be told that hakas do not exist any more but they will remain in Takshak and work closely with Tukas as normal warriors. Even lower generation haka will also not know they are tunams but special warrior tribe.

Only unattended part was kingdom of Maharajya beyond great western deserts. Desert always restricted Maharajya to take large army to Takshak. Still, Nagas and Karas were assigned to keep them in check.

This whole system provided even better security to Takshak and ensured lower generation tunams do not unnecessarily fight each other. However only first generation tunams and king of Takshak were aware of this secret security arrangement for Takshak.
